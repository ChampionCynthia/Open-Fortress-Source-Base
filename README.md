# Open Fortress Source Base

This is a WIP code base for the reverse engineered Team Fortress 2 binaries.
The code here is based off of Valve's Source SDK 2013 base which can be found [here](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013).

The reverse engineering is based off of the Mac binaries of a build of TF2 released early in 2020.

#### NOTE: This code is highly WIP!

Although we try and make our commits not break the ability to compile, due to the nature of this stage in the project, occasionally the master branch will fail compiling.  Please be patient as we work on completing this.

Things that we are working on are marked with an `OFSTATUS` or `OFTODO` comment.

#### Note about Pull Requests

We have decided to not accept any PRs for the time being due to the inability to verify that the code has been legitimately reverse engineered.
